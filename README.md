<summary> Definition From Wikipedia </summary>

> **Astrobiology** (also **xenology** or **exobiology**) is a scientific field within the [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_life_sciences "List of life sciences") and [environmental sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_science "Environmental science") that studies the [origins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis "Abiogenesis"), [early evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocell "Protocell"), distribution, and future of [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life "Life") in the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") by investigating its deterministic conditions and contingent events. [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrobiology#cite_note-about-2)] As a discipline, astrobiology is founded on the premise that life may exist beyond Earth. [[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrobiology#cite_note-3)]
>
> Research in astrobiology comprises three main areas: the study of [habitable environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_habitability "Planetary habitability") in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System "Solar System") and beyond, the search for planetary [biosignatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosignatures "Biosignatures") of past or present extraterrestrial life, and the study of the [origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis "Abiogenesis") and [early evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocell "Protocell") of life on Earth.
>
> The field of astrobiology has its origins in the 20th century with the advent of [space exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration "Space exploration") and the discovery of [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanets "Exoplanets"). Early astrobiology research focused on the search for extraterrestrial life and the study of the potential for life to exist on other planets. [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrobiology#cite_note-about-2)] In the 1960s and 1970s, NASA began its astrobiology pursuits within the [Viking program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_program "Viking program"), which was the first US mission to land on Mars and search for [signs of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_biological_experiments "Viking biological experiments"). [[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrobiology#cite_note-4)] This mission, along with other early space exploration missions, laid the foundation for the development of astrobiology as a discipline.
